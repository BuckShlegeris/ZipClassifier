ZipClassifier
=============

ZipClassifier is an easier to install version of CompLearn,
with only a text based interface.

It uses gzip to determine similarity between files, then
clusters them into a tree.

It works with both Python 2 and 3.

Usage:
python zipClassifier.py ~Documents/examples/10-mammals/*
